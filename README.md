At+Vv-> refers to the phylogenetic tree containing A. thaliana and V. vinifera R2R3 MYB family. 

At+Cs-> refers to the phylogenetic tree containing A. thaliana and C. sativa R2R3 MYB family.

At+Vv Tree. Grapevine accessions show the cultivars of origen (PN: Pinot Noir, CV: Corvina, ML: Merlot) and the A. thaliana were taken from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database. The alignment of the sequences was performed with MUSCLE
(parameters by default). By using MEGA X, the best protein model (ML), searched based on the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score, corresponded to the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model and rates among sites following a gamma 
distribution (G).  This analysis was carried on MrBayes software and 10 millions generations were performed with a final standard desviation(sd)=0.092521 Numbers in branches display the probability of a correct tree according to our data.Branches are
couloured according to their probability. 

At+Cs Tree. A. thaliana sequences  were taken from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database and  C. sativa MYBs present the same name as the published by (Bassolino et al., 2020). The alignment of the sequences was performed with MUSCLE
(parameters by default). By using MEGA X, the best protein model (ML), searched based on the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score, corresponded to the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model and rates among sites following a gamma 
distribution (G).  This analysis was carried on MrBayes software and 12.5 millions generations were performed with a final standard desviation(sd)=0.098034 Numbers in branches display the probability of a correct tree according to our data.Branches are
couloured according to their probability.
